**HTML** is the standard markup language for creating web pages.It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, it describes the structure of web pages using markup,
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages, it elements are represented by tags, it tags mark portions of content such as "heading", "paragraph paragraph", "table table", and so on Browsers do not display HTML tags, but rather use them to display page content.

*The HTML* code is made up of characters that live inside angledbrackets â€” these are called HTML elements. Elements are usuallymade up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing taghas an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browsersomething about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.
