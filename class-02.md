● Structural markup: the elements that you can use to
describe both headings and paragraphs.


*For Exampele*
<sup>
The <sup> element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts likeraising a number to a power such
as 22
  
<sub>
The <sub> element is used to contain characters that should be subscript. It is commonly used with foot notes or chemical formulas such as H20.





● Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on.


*For Example*


<stong> <em> <blockquote> <q> <abbr> <cite> <dfn>
  
 ### CSS Selector
 
 There are many different typesof CSS selector such as(Universal Selector,Type Selector,Class Selector,ID Selector ,Child Selector ,Descendant Selector,Adjacent Sibling, SelectorGeneral ,SiblingSelector) that allow you to target rules to specific elements in an HTML document.CSS selectors are case sensitive,
so they must match elementnames and attribute values exactly.


### javascript
It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the . j sextension.  The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file). If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, because the script works with the model of the web
page that the browser has created.
