● Structural markup: the elements that you can use to
describe both headings and paragraphs.
*For Exampele*
*<sup>
The <sup> element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts likeraising a number to a power such
as 22
  
* <sub>
The <sub> element is used to contain characters that should be subscript. It is commonly used with foot notes or chemical formulas such as H20.





● Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on.


*For Example*
<stong> <em> <blockquote> <q> <abbr> <cite> <dfn>
  
 ### CSS Selector
 
 There are many different typesof CSS selector such as(Universal Selector,Type Selector,Class Selector,ID Selector ,Child Selector ,Descendant Selector,Adjacent Sibling, SelectorGeneral ,SiblingSelector) that allow you to target rules to specific elements in an HTML document.CSS selectors are case sensitive,
so they must match elementnames and attribute values exactly.
