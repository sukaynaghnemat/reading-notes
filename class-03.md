# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

### There are  three different type of html lists:

* Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number.


* Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).
* Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.

## Box Dimensions (height, width)


By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents. To set your own dimensions for a
box you can use the height and width properties. The most popular ways tospecify the size of a box are
to use pixels, percentages, or ems. Traditionally, pixels have been the most popular method 
because they allow designers to accurately control their size.


## Overflow

The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself.
It can have one of two values:

* hidden
This property simply hides any extra content that does not fit in the box.

* scroll
This property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to see the missing content.



## Border Margin Padding

* Border: The border separates the edge of one box from another.


* Margin: Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.

* Padding Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.


## SWITCH STATEMENTS


A switch statement starts with avariable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the
variable matches that value.
