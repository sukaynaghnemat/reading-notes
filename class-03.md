# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

### There is three different type of lists:

* Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number.


* Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).
* Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.
