#  HTML Links, CSS Layout, JS Functions

## Whats is link?

* Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another â€” enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.

* Links are created using the <a> element which has an attribute called href. The value of thehref attribute is the page that you want people to go to when
  they click on the link.
* Users can click on anything that appears between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag and will be taken to the page specified in the href attribute.
	
* If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.

 #  positioning schemes
 
 * that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position
 property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.
 
 * Normal flow : Every block-level element appears on a new line, causing each item to appear lower down the page than the previous one.
 
 * Relative Positioning This moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top, right, bottom, 
    or left of where it would have been placed. 
    
 * Absolute positioning This positions the element in relation to its containing element. It is taken out of normal flow, meaning that it does not affect the position
   of any surrounding elements.
