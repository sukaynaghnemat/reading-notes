#  HTML Links, CSS Layout, JS Functions

## Whats is link?

* Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another â€” enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.

* Links are created using the <a> element which has an attribute called href. The value of thehref attribute is the page that you want people to go to when
  they click on the link.
* Users can click on anything that appears between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag and will be taken to the page specified in the href attribute.
