# Images
### A picture can say a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one.
#### Image should be:


 * relevant.
 * Convey information.
 * Convey the right mood.
 * Be instantly recognisable.
 * Fit the color palette.
 
 
 ## Three Rules for Creating Images
  *1* Save images in the right format.
  *2* Save images at the right size.
  *3* Use the correct resolution.
  
 
 
 
 # how can you add image in your page:
 
 * you need to use an <img> element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag).
 * you must carry the following attribute: **src** This tells the browser where it can find the image file. 
 This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site. **alt** This provides a text description
 of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.

 # Aligning
 * The align attribute was commonly used to indicate how the other parts of a page should flow around an image. It has
   been removed from HTML5 and new websites should use CSS to control the alignment of images.

 ### css

 * CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
 * Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).
 * Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. 
  For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
  
  ### hsl, hsla

* hsl  The hsl color property has been introduced in CSS3 as an alternative way to specify colors.
The value of the property startswith the letters hsl, followedby individual values insideparentheses. 


* hsla The hsla color property allows you to specify color properties using hue, saturation, and
lightness as above, and adds a fourth value which represents transparency.
