# Images
### A picture can say a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one.
#### Image should be:


 * relevant.
 * Convey information.
 * Convey the right mood.
 * Be instantly recognisable.
 * Fit the color palette.
 
 
 # how can you add image in your page:
 
 * you need to use an <img> element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag).
 * you must carry the following attribute: **src** This tells the browser where it can find the image file. 
 This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site. **alt** This provides a text description
 of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.

 # Aligning
 * The align attribute was commonly used to indicate how the other parts of a page should flow around an image. It has
   been removed from HTML5 and new websites should use CSS to control the alignment of images.
