# FORM

* Traditionally, the term 'form' has referred to a printed document that contains
spaces for you to fill in information. HTML borrows the concept of a form to refer to different
elements that allow you to collect information from visitors to your site.

### Form Structure

* <form>
Form controls live inside a <form> element. This element should always 
carry the action attribute and will usually have a method and id attribute too.

* action
Every <form> element requires an action attribute. Its value is the URL for the page on the
server that will receive the information in the form when it is submitted.

* method
Forms can be sent using one of two methods: get or post.
