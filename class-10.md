# Debugging

## What is Debugging?
* In computer programming and software development, debugging is the process of finding and resolving bugs (defects or problems that prevent correct operation) within computer programs, software, or systems.

* Debugging is the process of finding errors. It involves a process of deduction.

## Execution contexts

* Execution contexts: Roughly equates to the 'environment' a function executes in; that is, variable scope (and the scope chain, variables in closures from outer scopes), function arguments, and the value of the this object.


## Types Of Errors:

## HOW TO DEAL WITH ERRORS


* 1: DEBUG THE SCRIPT TO FIX ERRORS If you come across an error while writing a script
(or when someone reports a bug), you will need to debug the code, track down the source of the error, and fix it.

* 2: HANDLE ERRORS GRACEFULLY You can handle errors gracefully using try, catch, throw, and f i na 1 ly statements.

## CONSOLE

* The JavaScript console will tell you when there is a problem with a script,
where to look for the problem, and what kind of issue it seems to be.


* The JavaScript console is just one of several developer tools that are
found in all modern browsers.
