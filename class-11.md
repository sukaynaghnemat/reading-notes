# IMAGES IN CSS
* You can control the size of an
image using the width and
height properties in CSS, just
like you can for any other box.
Specifying image sizes helps
pages to load more smoothly
because the HTML and CSS
code will often load before the
images, and telling the browser
how much space to leave for an
image allows it to render the rest
of the page without waiting for
the image to download.

 ## Aligning images using css

 * Aligning an image means to position the image at center, left and right. We can use the float property and text-align property for the alignment of images.

If the image is in the div element, then we can use the text-align property for aligning the image in the div.

## Centering images Using Css

* By default, images are inline
elements. This means that they
flow within the surrounding text.
In order to center an image, it
should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display
property with a value of block.
Once it has been made into a
block-level element, there are
two common ways in which you
can horizontally center an image:
  * 1: On the containing element,
you can use the text-align
property with a value of center.
  * 2: On the image itself, you can
use the use the margin property
and set the values of the left and
right margins to auto.


## Background Images

* The background-image
property allows you to place
an image behind any HTML
element. This could be the entire
page or just part of the page. By
default, a background image will
repeat to fill the entire box.

## background-repeat
* The background-repeat
property can have four values:


 * repeat
The background image is
repeated both horizontally and
vertically (the default way it
is shown if the backgroundrepeat property isn't used)
 
 * repeat-x
The image is repeated
horizontally only (as shown in
the first example on the left).

* repeat-y
The image is repeated vertically
only.

* no-repeat
The image is only shown once.

## Background Position


* When an image is not being
repeated, you can use the
background-position
property to specify where in the
browser window the background
image should be placed.
This property usually has a pair
of values. The first represents
the horizontal position and the
second represents the vertical.

* (left top , left center , left bottom ,center top ,center center ,center bottom ,right top ,right center ,right bottom)

## Designing Navigation
*  It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.

* Site navigation not only helps people find where they want to go, but also
helps them understand what your site is about and how it is organized.
Good navigation tends to follow these principles...


* Concise
Ideally, the navigation should
be quick and easy to read.

* Clear
Users should be able to predict
the kind of information that
they will find on the page
before clicking on the link.

* Selective
The primary navigation should
only reflect the sections or
content of the site. 

* Context
Good navigation provides
context.

* Interactive
Each link should be big enough
to click on

* Consistent
The more pages a site contains,
the larger the number of
navigation items there will be.
Although secondary navigation
will change from page to page,
it is best to keep the primary
navigation exactly the same.
