# CANVAS

# What is the canvas?

* The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript).

The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics. You must use a script to actually draw the graphics.

Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.

### HTML Canvas Can Draw Text
Canvas can draw colorful text, with or without animation.

### HTML Canvas Can Draw Graphics
Canvas has great features for graphical data presentation with an imagery of graphs and charts.

### HTML Canvas Can be Animated
Canvas objects can move. Everything is possible: from simple bouncing balls to complex animations.

### HTML Canvas Can be Interactive
Canvas can respond to JavaScript events.

Canvas can respond to any user action (key clicks, mouse clicks, button clicks, finger movement).


### The <canvas> element

The <canvas> element must have an id attribute so it can be referred to by JavaScript.

The width and height attribute is necessary to define the size of the canvas.

* The id attribute isn't specific to the <canvas> element but is one of the global HTML attributes which can be applied to any HTML element (like class for instance). It is always a good idea to supply an id because this makes it much easier to identify it in a script.



The <canvas> element can be styled just like any normal image (margin, border, backgroundâ€¦). These rules, however, don't affect the actual drawing on the canvas. We'll see how this is done in a dedicated chapter of this tutorial. When no styling rules are applied to the canvas it will initially be fully transparent.
