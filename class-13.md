# LOCAL STORAGE 

## What is localStorage?

* localStorage is a property that allows JavaScript sites and apps to save key/value pairs in a web browser with no expiration date. This means the data stored in the browser will persist even after the browser window is closed.

## How does localStorage work?

* To use localStorage in your web applications, there are five methods to choose from:

setItem(): Add key and value to localStorage.
getItem(): This is how you get items from localStorage.
removeItem(): Remove an item by key from localStorage.
clear(): Clear all localStorage.
key(): Passed a number to retrieve the key of a localStorage.

## setItem(): How to store values in localStorage

* It takes two parameters: a key and a value. The key can be referenced later to fetch the value attached to it.

## getItem(): How to get items from localStorage

* To get items from localStorage, use the getItem() method. getItem() allows you to access the data stored in the browserâ€™s localStorage object.

getItem() accepts only one parameter, which is the key, and returns the value as a string.


## removeItem(): How to delete localStorage sessions

* To delete local storage sessions, use the removeItem() method.

When passed a key name, the removeItem() method removes that key from the storage if it exists. If there is no item associated with the given key, this method will do nothing.



## clear(): How to delete all items in localStorage

* Use the clear() method to delete all items in localStorage.

This method, when invoked, clears the entire storage of all records for that domain. It does not receive any parameters.


## key(): How to get the name of a key in localStorage

* The key() method comes in handy in situations where you need to loop through keys and allows you to pass a number or index to localStorage to retrieve the name of the key.
