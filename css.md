**CSS** allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. For example, you can specify that the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.



**<style>**
You can also include CSS rules within an HTML page by placing them inside a <style> element, which usually sits inside the <head> element of the page.
The <style> element should use the type attribute to indicate that the styles are specified in CSS. The value should be text/ css.
When building a site with more than one page, you should use an external CSS style sheet. This:
● Allows all pages to use the same style rules (rather than repeating them in each page).
● Keeps the content separate from how the page looks.
● Means you can change the styles used across all pages by altering just one file (rather than each individual page).
