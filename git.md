###GIT


Through Git, we can write a comment on every change we've made
We can also refer to any of the versions at the same time, and when changing in a particular version does not affect the rest of the versions
Which made these advantages a great impact in facing many of the problems of the same team working on the same project.
Also, in the past, we could not modify the project as more than one person at the same time, and there were many copies of the same project on each team's computer, which caused many problems that were solved by git.
