# loop and comparsion
## summrized:

* Comparison operators — operators that compare values and return true or false. The operators include: >, <, >=, <=, ===, and !==.

* Logical operators — operators that combine multiple boolean expressions or values and provide a single boolean output. The operators include: &&, ||, and !.

**Comparison operators** allow us to assert the equality of a statement with JavaScript. For example, we can assert whether two values or expressions are equal with ===, or, whether one value is greater than another with >.

There are scenarios, however, in which we must assert whether multiple values or expressions are true. In JavaScript, we can use logical operators to make these assertions.

&& (and) — This operator will be truthy (act like true) if and only if the expressions on both sides of it are true.
|| (or) — This operator will be truthy if the expression on either side of it is true. Otherwise, it will be falsy (act like false).
