#Markdown


*It is a markup language used to format writing in an easy way, and then it is electronically converted to other formats such as HTML to be displayed. It has the advantage of being simple formatting marks so that the text can be read even before the conversion process*

*It can be written using regular text editors, and special programs can be used that display results directly and facilitate the formatting process for some complex operations such as images, links and tables, which are somewhat difficult compared to other formatting symbols. Usually, the files used in the MARCdown format are saved with the extension .md*
